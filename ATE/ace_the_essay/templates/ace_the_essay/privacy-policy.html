    <p>
      As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses
      cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer in
      order to improve your experience. This page describes what information
      they gather, how we use it, and why we sometimes need to store these
      cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being
      stored; however, this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the
      sites functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more general information on cookies see the Wikipedia article on HTTP
      Cookies.
    </p>
    <h4 class="pt-4 pb-2">How we use cookies?</h4>
    <p>
      We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately, in
      most cases there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies
      without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to
      this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not
      sure whether you need them in case they are used to provide a service that
      you use.
    </p>
    <h4 class="pt-4 pb-2">Disabling Cookies</h4>
    <p>
      You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your
      browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that
      disabling cookies could affect the functionality of this and many other
      websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also
      disabling certain functionality and features of this site. Therefore, it
      is recommended that you do not disable cookies.
    </p>
    <h4 class="pt-4 pb-2">The cookies we set</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Account related cookies:</b> If you create an account with us, then
        we will use cookies for the management of the signup process and general
        administration. These cookies will usually be deleted when you log out.
        However, in some cases they may remain afterwards to remember your site
        preferences when logged out.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Login related cookies:</b> We use cookies when you are logged in so
        that we can remember this fact. This prevents you from having to log in
        every single time you visit a new page. These cookies are typically
        removed or cleared when you log out to ensure that you can only access
        restricted features and areas when logged in.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Site preferences cookies:</b> In order to provide you with the best
        experience on this site we provide the functionality to set your
        preferences for how this site runs when you use it. In order to remember
        your preferences we need to set cookies so that this information can be
        called up whenever you interact with a page.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="pt-4 pb-2">Third-party cookies</h4>
    <p>
      In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third
      parties. The following section details which third-party cookies you might
      encounter through this site.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

        trusted analytics solutions currently on the web for helping us to
        understand how you use the site and ways that we can improve your
        experience. These cookies may track things such as how long you spend on
        the site and the pages that you visit so we can continue to produce
        engaging content.

    <p>
      Hopefully that has clarified things for you and, as was previously
      mentioned, if there is something that you are not sure whether you need or
      not, it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact
      with one of the features you use on our site.
